## Monitoring and Logging

For monitoring we use two main tools:

- Sentry, which is used for error tracking
- Cronitor, which is used for monitoring the health of the services

Both tools can be set up using the following environment variables:

- `SENTRY_SDN=https://asd1asd2.ingest.sentry.io/asd1asd2`
- `CRONITOR_API_KEY=asd1asd2`
